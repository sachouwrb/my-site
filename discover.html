				<h2><em>SWORD ART ONLINE</em></h2>
				<p class="text1">The year is 2022, and <strong>gamers</strong> have lined up on launch day for Sword Art Online, a hotly-anticipated <strong>MMORPG</strong> that lets players connect to an immersive <strong>virtual reality world</strong> with special helmets called Nerve Gear. <strong>Kirito</strong> is one such gamer who's eager to jump back into action, having spent a great deal of time as a beta tester, and quickly becomes friends with newbie warrior Klein. But soon, Sword Art Online's 10,000 players discover that not only are they <strong>unable to log out</strong>, the only way they can return to their physical bodies is by <strong>beating</strong> the 100-level tower's final boss - <strong>death</strong> in the game means death in the real world. Now, with no one else to turn to, Kirito and the other participants <strong>must survive</strong> the game as best they can.</p>
